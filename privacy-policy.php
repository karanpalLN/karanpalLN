							<p>These general terms of use and legal information (hereinafter, the “General Terms”) apply to the website of Drivaja, S.L. (hereinafter, “Driva”), whose domain is  https://drivaja.com, and to its related mobile application, as well as to all its related sites or sites linked from https://drivaja.com by Driva, as well as its affiliated companies and associates, as set forth in Annex I, including Driva’s websites worldwide (hereinafter and collectively, the “Site”). The site belongs to Driva. By using the site, you accept and expressly agree to these terms of use. If you do not agree, please refrain from using it.</p>

							<p>Driva hereby makes the Driva website and mobile application (hereinafter, jointly, the “Platform”) available to users (hereinafter, the “User” or “Users”).</p>

							<p>In accordance with the provisions of the applicable legislation, the following identification details of the site owner are provided below:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Company name: Drivaja, S.L.</li>
							<li>Registered address: XXXXXXX.</li>
							<li>Commercial Register registration details: XXXXXXXX.</li>
							<li>Tax Identification Number (NIF): XXXXXXXX </li> </ul>
							<p><b>1. Object</b></p>

							<p>Driva is a technology company whose main activity is the development and management of a technology platform through which certain local stores in a number of territories can offer their products and/or services by means of a mobile or web application on the platform (hereinafter, the “APP”) and, in an ancillary manner, where applicable and if so requested through the APP by users of the APP and consumers of the said local stores, act as an intermediary in the planned or immediate delivery of the products.</p>

							<p>Driva has developed a Platform through which a variety of merchants, with which Driva can have in place a commercial agreement for the use of the platform, offer a selection of products and/or services. Users can request the purchase and/or collection of products and services from such merchants in person by means of a mandate given by them to a third party when placing an order through the Platform. In such cases, Driva acts as a mere intermediary and is therefore unable to assume, and does not assume, any responsibility for the quality of the products or for the proper provision of the services offered directly by the merchants or by such third parties.</p>

							<p>In addition, Driva is a multi-category Technology Platform for intermediation in the contracting of “on demand” services by distance electronic means. Its aim is to make it easier for any persons requiring help with their errands, services, purchases in person and/or collection of products from local merchants (hereinafter, “Users”) to carry out their errands by delegating to such third parties, who are willing to voluntarily carry out the mandate given to them by Users (hereinafter, the “Mandataries”).</p>

							<p>Mandataries are thus a network of self-employed professionals who work with Driva. When they wish to provide their services, they log onto the Driva Platform and undertake to carry out within a certain amount of time the service entrusted to them by the User by means of the above-mentioned mandate. As a result, Driva cannot be responsible for delivery times, as they will depend on the local stores’ own successful operations, the preparation of orders, the Mandataries themselves, and the information furnished by Users when placing orders or their availability and response at the time of delivery. In relation to this, the delivery times stated on the Site are provided for indicative purposes only.</p>

							<p>Driva hereby confirms that it has obtained all necessary licences for the pursuit of its commercial activities in the countries in which it operates.</p>

							<p>Throughout these General Terms of Use, both Users and Mandataries will be referred to as Users of the Platform.</p>

							<p><b>2. Terms of Use</b></p>

							<p>By accessing the Platform and voluntarily creating a profile, all Users acknowledge and expressly and unambiguously agree to these General Terms of Use and Contracting as well as to the Privacy Policy and the Cookie Policy.</p>

							<p><b>3. User Access and Registration</b></p>

							<p>In order to be a User of the Platform, it is essential that you meet the following requirements:</p>

							<p></p><p>Users must be at least 18 years of age.</p>
							Users must truthfully complete the mandatory fields of the registration form requesting personal details such as the User’s name, e-mail address, telephone number and bank card number.<p></p>
							<ul>
							<li>Users must agree to these Terms of Use and Contracting.</li>
							<li>Users must agree to the Privacy and Data Protection Policy.</li>
							<li>Users must agree to the Cookie Policy. </li> </ul>

							<p>The User warrants that all the information regarding his/her identity and capacity provided to Driva in the registration forms for the Platform is true, accurate and complete. In addition, Users undertake to keep their details up to date.</p>

							<p>If a User provides any false, inaccurate or incomplete information or if Driva considers that there are well founded reasons to doubt the truthfulness, accuracy or integrity of such information, Driva may deny that User current or future access to, and use of, the Platform or any of its contents and/or services.</p>

							<p>When registering on the Platform, Users must choose a username and password. Both the username and the password are strictly confidential, personal and non-transferable. In order to increase the security of accounts, Driva recommends that Users do not use the same login credentials as on other platforms. If a User uses the same login credentials as on other platforms, Driva will be unable to guarantee the security of the account or ensure that the User is the only person logging into his/her profile.</p>

							<p>Users undertake not to disclose the details of their account or allow access thereto to third parties. Users shall be solely responsible for any use of such details or of the services of the Site that may be made by third parties, including the statements and/or contents entered on the Platform, or for any other action carried out under their username and/or password.</p>

							<p>Users are the sole owners of the content entered by them on the Platform. Furthermore, by registering on the Platform and agreeing to these Terms, the User grants Driva, in relation to the content that he/she may provide, a worldwide, irrevocable, and transferable licence, free of charge, with the right to sub-license, use, copy, modify, create derivative works, distribute, publicise and exploit it in any way that may be deemed appropriate by Driva, with or without any further communication to the User and without having to pay any amounts for such uses.</p>

							<p>Driva cannot guarantee the identity of registered Users, and it will therefore not be liable for the use by unregistered third parties of a registered User’s identity. Users undertake to inform Driva immediately, using the communication channels made available by Driva, if their credentials are stolen, disclosed or lost.</p>
